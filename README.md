# Farmers-Dashboard

This dashboard is built to uncover the different characteristics of customers who have a home policy and customers who are cross sold.

In the left navigation bar, you can choose the overview tab to understand the distribution of the important characteristics among customers in Arizona. You can also dive into the correlation between two chosen variables.

In the comparison tab, you can explore the difference of the selected characteristic between the two groups. 

In the map tab, an interactive part is provided so that you can gain an understanding of how our customers distribute across Arizona. Specifically, you may filter customers by whether they have auto insurance and whether they have umbrella insurance.

There are four categories of characteristics, which are policy, property condition, safeness, and client. You can select the category first in the first drop-down menu, then choose the variable you want.
